JDK
JDK (Java Development Kit) is for developing Java programs
it has everything t0 - create, modify, compile, test, debug, run java programs and applications
JRE + JVM + Utilities (javac, javap, jar, javadoc etc)

JRE (Java Runtime Environment)
Contains helper classes and files and JVM to run Java applications.
Java standard libraries are included in JRE ( classes in java.lang package , java.util etc )

JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
is the platform that loads program into memory and executes Java bytecode >> .class file
Runs bytecode and doesnt matter on which platform it was compiled
applications code .java can run on any machine ( provided the machine have compatible JVM )
WORA = write once run anywhere

JVM >> platform dependent differs for different platform like windows, mac, linux etc.
.class file (bytecode) >> produced by the Java compiler (javac) is platform-independent.

Program File name >> abc.java
Class name >> Test.java
javac >> file name >>
