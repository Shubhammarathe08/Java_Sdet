2. verification vs validation

 | **Aspect**       | **Verification**                                     | **Validation**
 | ---------------- | -----------------------------------------------------| -----------------------------------------------------
 | **Definition**   | Checking **documents, design, code**                 | Testing the **actual product by executing code**
                      without execution to ensure                            to ensure it meets **customer needs**.
                      **requirements are correctly implemented**.

 | **Type**         | **Static testing** (reviews, walkthroughs inspection)| **Dynamic testing** (black box, functional tests).
 | **Focus**        | **"Are we building the product right?"**              | **"Are we building the right product?"**
 | **Performed By** | QA team (reviewers, analysts).                        | Testing team (testers, QA).
 | **When**         | Done **before validation**, early phase in SDLC.      | Done **after verification**, on the working product.
 | **Example**      | Reviewing BRS, SRS, design documents.                 | Testing login functionality on actual app.|

5. incremental vs iterative

| **Aspect**   | **Incremental SDLC**                             | **Iterative SDLC**                                               |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Approach** | Build system in **small functional increments**. | Build **entire system in basic form**, refine in iterations.     |
| **Focus**    | **Adding new features with each increment**.     | **Improving existing features with each iteration**.             |
| **Output**   | Each increment adds a **new feature/module**.    | Each iteration produces a **better version of the same system**. |
| **Example**  | Add login → dashboard → reports                  | Build full app v1 → improve UI v2 → add validations v3           |

6. smoke (stable build and critical leakage) vs sanity (check health of application)
| **Aspect**         | **Smoke Testing**                                                                         | **Sanity Testing**                                                                                            |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**     | A **quick, basic check** to verify if the **build is stable enough for further testing**. | A **narrow, focused check** to verify **specific functionality or bug fixes** work as expected after changes. |
| **Purpose**        | To ensure **critical functionalities work and build is testable**.                        | To ensure **new functionalities or bug fixes work correctly** without detailed regression.                    |
| **Performed When** | **New build is received** to decide whether to accept it for further testing.             | After **receiving a minor release or bug fix** to verify correctness.                                         |
| **Coverage**       | **Wide coverage**, shallow testing across major features.                                 | **Deep coverage**, narrow testing on specific modules or features.                                            |
| **Performed By**   | Testers (sometimes developers for initial build checks).                                  | Testers.                                                                                                      |
| **Example**        | In a banking app, checking if login page loads, dashboard opens, and logout works.        | After fixing a bug in the fund transfer module, checking only fund transfer functionality to confirm the fix. |
| **Time Taken**     | Quick – **30 mins to few hours**.                                                         | Also quick, but more focused – **few mins to an hour**.                                                       |
| **Documentation**  | Often **documented as build verification tests**.                                         | Usually **not formally documented**, done for confidence before regression.                                   |
| **Other Name**     | **Build Verification Testing (BVT)**.                                                     | **Subset of regression testing**.                                                                             |

7. Re-testing (checked failed test cases ) vs Regression Testing
| **Aspect**               | **Re-testing**                                                                              | **Regression Testing**                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**           | Testing **failed test cases again** after fixing defects to confirm the defect is resolved. | Testing existing functionalities to ensure **new changes have not introduced defects** in previously working areas.                          |
| **Purpose**              | To verify **bug fix works as expected**.                                                    | To check that **unchanged parts of the application still work correctly** after new changes.                                                 |
| **Test Cases**           | Same test cases which previously failed are re-executed.                                    | Test cases covering **affected modules and related areas** are executed.                                                                     |
| **Planned or Unplanned** | **Not planned** – executed only when defects are fixed.                                     | **Planned testing activity** in test strategy after any changes or enhancements.                                                             |
| **Performed When**       | After a defect fix is deployed.                                                             | After **any new feature, bug fix, or enhancement** deployment.                                                                               |
| **Example**              | Login failed due to incorrect password validation logic – tester re-tests after fix.        | After changing password validation logic, regression tests ensure that registration, reset password, and login flows are still working fine. |
