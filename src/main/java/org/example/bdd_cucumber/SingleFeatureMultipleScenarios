  I want to log into the e-commerce site
  So that I can access my account and make purchases

  Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials
    Given I am on the login page
    When I enter valid username "testuser@example.com" and password "Secure123!"
    And I click the login button
    Then I should be redirected to my account dashboard
    And I should see a welcome message "Welcome back, Test User"

  Scenario: Login fails with incorrect password
    Given I am on the login page
    When I enter valid username "testuser@example.com" and invalid password "wrongpass"
    And I click the login button
    Then I should see an error message "Invalid credentials"
    And I should remain on the login page

  Scenario: Login fails with empty password
    Given I am on the login page
    When I enter valid username "testuser@example.com" and leave password empty
    And I click the login button
    Then I should see an error message "Password cannot be empty"
    And the login button should be disabled
