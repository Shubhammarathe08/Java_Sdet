----------------------    Problems with Array     -------------------

arrays - fixed size collection of homogenous elements/objects

1. fixed size | need to know in advance
2. can hold only homogenous elements
3. wastage of memory wastage if ele are not as of size
4. cant expand on demand/requirement
5. programmer need to write logic for so many frequently operations
6. no underlying data structure
7. arrays concept not implemented on standard DS, hence ready made method support not available
8. memory wise arrays not recommended
9. can be used to hold primitives and objects

Adv ***
good performance

-------------------------   Why Collection   --------------------------

collection - represent group of individual objects as a single entity

1. growable in nature | increase/decrease based on requirements
2. homogenous and heterogeneous type of data it can hold
3. every collection class is implemented in some standard DS for multiple requirement, ready made support available
4. being programmer , we can use those methods , not for implementing for frequently used operation
5. memory wise arrays  recommended
6. collection can only hold objects

Adv ***
performance wise , not up to the mark

--------------------------  Collection Framework   ----------------------

several Classes , Interfaces >> to represent collection as an entity for representing group of individual objects
